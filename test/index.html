                Lingopie is the world's only language learning application that uses real TV shows
                and movies to help you learn a new language. The idea is to make language learning
                as simple as watching your favorite TV show.
              </p>
              <p>
                We use real TV shows & movies from the language you want to learn. Each show comes
                with subtitles in the original language (ex. Spanish TV Show + Spanish Subtitles).
                Every word, phrase or slang is clickable to give you an instant translation in
                real-time to help you learn.
              </p>
              <p>
                After you watch an episode you can easily review all your new vocabulary & grammar
                rules with our built-in flashcards and word lists.
              </p>

                Lingopie is great for all levels, from beginner to advanced, with great content and
                language learning tools appropriate for everyone.

                Don't worry! Even if you are a beginner, getting started is easy. You'll find
                interesting TV shows for any level. Plus you can slow down the video playback speed
                to make it easier to hear the words. You also get the corresponding English
                subtitles so that you can easily follow along if you want a more casual binge
                watching experience.
              </p>
              <p>
                After just a couple of episodes you'll notice that your comprehension has increased
                drastically and you can follow along with much of the conversation and dialogue.

              <p>
                After only 3 or 4 episodes, you'll notice a serious improvement in your listening
                comprehension and vocabulary. The most important thing is to select a TV series that
                you'll enjoy.
              </p>
              <p>
                After a full season of at least 8 episodes your confidence and comprehension will
                skyrocket. As you watch your brain will be rewired to quickly acquire new words,
                phrases, slang and grammar from the natural context of the TV shows and movies and
                you'll see your confidence go through the roof. The more you watch, the more you
                learn.
